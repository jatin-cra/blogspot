            <h1>What is a blog ?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="upper_sec_content">
            <p>A blog is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, 
                often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, 
                so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work 
                of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic.
                 In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes 
                 professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and 
                 similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" 
                 systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to 
                 maintain or add content to a blog.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="upper_sec_content">
            <p>The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997. The short form, "blog", 
                was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the 
                sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999. Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams 
                at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post 
                to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading 
                to the popularization of the terms.</p>

            <h1>Types</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="upper_sec_content">
            <p>There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in 
                the way that content is delivered or written.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog_type">

            <ul>
                <li>Personal Blogs</li>
                    <p>The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a 
                        corporation or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, 
                        other than the blogger's immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have become 
                        popular, to the point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A tiny number of 
                        personal bloggers have become famous, both in the online community and in the real world.</p>
                <li>By Genre</li>
                    <p>Some blogs focus on a particular subject, such as political blogs, journalism blogs, health blogs, 
                        <a href="#h1" class="headline">travel blogs</a>  (also known as travelogs), gardening blogs, house blogs, <a href="#h2" class="headline">Book Blogs</a>, 
                        fashion blogs, beauty blogs, lifestyle blogs, party blogs, <a href="#h3" class="headline">Food blogs</a>, wedding blogs,
                         photography blogs, project blogs, psychology blogs, sociology blogs, education blogs,
                          niche blogs, classical music blogs, quizzing blogs, legal blogs (often referred to as a blawgs), or dreamlogs. 
                          How-to/Tutorial blogs are becoming increasing popular. Two common types of genre blogs are art blogs and music
                           blogs. A blog featuring discussions especially about home and family is not uncommonly called a mom blog 
                           and one made popular is by Erica Diamond who created Womenonthefence.com which is syndicated to over two 
                           million readers monthly. While not a legitimate type of blog, one used for the sole purpose of spamming 
                           is known as a splog.</p>
                <li>By Media type</li>
                    <p>A blog comprising videos is called a vlog, one comprising links is called a linklog, a site containing a 
                        portfolio of sketches is called a sketchblog or one comprising photos is called a photoblog. Blogs with shorter
                         posts and mixed media types are called tumblelogs. Blogs that are written on typewriters and then scanned are 
                         called typecast or typecast blogs. A rare type of blog hosted on the Gopher Protocol is known as a phlog.</p>
