                    And it makes sense, as one also learns more by teaching. Since blogging requires you to research more, and come up with the best version of your knowledge. Many people like to write and they like to write for themselves. Basically, this is what blogging is all about. It’s why blogging started, and it’s why blogging exists. Most people just want to keep an online space for writing.

                    These people don’t care about the best blogging platforms, how to get more traffic, and how to increase the number of comments. They just love to write, and if someone comments, then hey, that’s good too.
                    
                    That said, blogging out of passion should be every blogger’s biggest reason for blogging.But most of the peoples really Don't know waht blogging is. So, Blogspot gives you a platform to learn about blogging and shring your blogs with the world.</p>
